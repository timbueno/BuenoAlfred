======
Collects comic book data from [PreviewsWorld](http://www.previewsworld.com). The current week and the following week's releases are collected and categorized. The workflow utilizes [alp](https://github.com/phyllisstein/alp) to facilitate the generation of Alfred Feedback data.

The workflow also implements a rudimentary menu system by exploiting Alfred's autocomplete mechanism.

* Actioning on a specific comic book opens the PreviewsWorld webpage description.
* Holding CMD while actioning on an item adds the selected comic book to Fantastical if it is installed.
