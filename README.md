Collects comic book data from [PreviewsWorld](www.previewsworld.com). The current week and the following week's releases are collected and categorized. The workflow utilizes [alp](https://github.com/phyllisstein/alp) to facilitate the generation of Alfred Feedback data.

The workflow also implements a rudimentary menu system by exploiting Alfred's autocomplete mechanism.
